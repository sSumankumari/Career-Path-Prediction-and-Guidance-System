# Career Path Prediction and Guidance System

This project is developed as part of an internship at Cloud Counselage Pvt. Ltd. where I worked as a Machine Learning Intern. The aim of the project is to create a Career Path Prediction and Guidance System using a Streamlit web application. This application provides users with personalized career path predictions based on various inputs related to their skills, certifications, workshops attended, and career interests.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for inputting personal ratings, scores, and career preferences.
- **Career Path Prediction:** Predicts the most suitable career path based on user inputs.
- **Guidance System:** Offers tailored guidance and recommendations to help users achieve their professional goals.

## Getting Started
